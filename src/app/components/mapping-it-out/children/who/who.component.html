				<span class="form-description indent">In the work comp world, a claims review can help determine if there are claims
					which have been open too long or claims which are in process and have reserves set too high. Our verbiage would look
					like this: S: When your current broker came out, probably around the first of October, to do a Claims Review and he
					got out . . . A list of your claims (Loss Runs) And looked through them to identify any claims where they’ve been going
					on too long or had the estimates (reserves) set too high, then took his findings to your underwriter so you wouldn’t
					have to worry about getting stuck paying higher premiums than you deserved, were you comfortable with how he did that?
