                    <p>The point is, asking a question like that one, or even a direct question like “If I come through with
                        what you want, can you fire your guy/gal?”, is likely to produce a thoughtless response or at least
                        one that isn’t thoroughly considered. The prospect isn’t necessarily lying, but they probably aren’t
                        taking your question seriously.</p>

                    <p>That is why it is necessary to follow a process which will put them in a position to consider the
                        topic and to understand you need a seriously considered response before moving on to the next step.</p>
